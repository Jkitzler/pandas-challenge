week 4 Homework
Two observations based on the Data analysis Panadas Homewwork:
    1.   Charter Schools dominated the top 5 schools in overall passing rate and District dominated the bottom 5.
    2.   Charter schools have smaller class sizes compared to district schools and the larger the class size, the lower the percentage of passing students.
